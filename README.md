# BeginnerBuyers
To help first time home buyers to begin the process
Below is a README file for the Python program designed to help first-time homebuyers create and manage their homebuying list.

First-Time Homebuyer List Creator
Overview
This Python program helps first-time homebuyers organize their priorities and requirements for purchasing a home. It prompts users to input details such as budget, must-have features, location preferences, and more, then displays and optionally saves the list as a JSON file for future reference.

Features
Interactive Input: Guides users through entering homebuying preferences across multiple categories.
Structured Output: Organizes inputs into a clear, categorized format (Budget, Must-Haves, Nice-to-Haves, etc.).
Display: Shows the completed list in a readable format.
Save Option: Saves the list as a JSON file (homebuyer_list.json) for easy access later.
Flexible: Allows users to skip inputs or finish sections early by typing 'done'.
Requirements
Python 3.x
No external libraries are required (uses built-in json module).
Installation
Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
Download or copy the homebuyer_list.py script to your local machine.
Usage
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing homebuyer_list.py.
Run the program:
bash

Copy
python homebuyer_list.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter your homebuying preferences:
Budget (e.g., max price, monthly payment, down payment).
Must-Have Features (e.g., number of bedrooms, bathrooms).
Nice-to-Have Features (e.g., modern kitchen, large backyard).
Location Preferences (e.g., specific neighborhoods, proximity to work).
Dealbreakers (e.g., major repairs, flood zones).
Future Needs (e.g., room for kids, home office).
Financing and Logistics (e.g., mortgage type, move-in timeline).
Review the displayed list.
Choose whether to save the list as a JSON file (homebuyer_list.json).
