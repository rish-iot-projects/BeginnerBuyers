First-Time Homebuyer List Creator
Overview
This Python program helps first-time homebuyers organize their priorities and requirements for purchasing a home. It prompts users to input details such as budget, must-have features, location preferences, and more, then displays and optionally saves the list as a JSON file for future reference.

Structured Output: Organizes inputs into a clear, categorized format (Budget, Must-Haves, Nice-to-Haves, etc.).
Display: Shows the completed list in a readable format.
Save Option: Saves the list as a JSON file (homebuyer_list.json) for easy access later.
Flexible: Allows users to skip inputs or finish sections early by typing 'done'.
